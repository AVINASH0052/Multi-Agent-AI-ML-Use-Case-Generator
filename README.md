# Multi-Agent AI/ML Use Case Generator

## Overview

This project utilizes a multi-agent system architecture to analyze a company's industry, segment, and strategic focus areas, generating relevant AI/ML use cases and identifying supporting datasets. The system leverages NVIDIA’s API and Kaggle resources to provide structured and actionable insights, aimed at aligning AI technology with business priorities.

## Methodology

The solution employs the following stages:

1. **Research Agent (Industry Analysis):** 
   - Queries NVIDIA’s API to identify the primary industries and strategic focus areas of a specified company.
   - Extracts and refines the top three industry categories and focus areas for precise use case generation.

2. **Use Case Generation Agent:** 
   - Utilizes NVIDIA’s API to generate specific AI/ML applications and their associated challenges and benefits within each industry-focus area intersection.

3. **Resource Asset Collection Agent:** 
   - Searches Kaggle for relevant datasets for each AI/ML use case.
   - Limits recommendations to top results for better readability and relevance.

4. **Final Proposal Generator:** 
   - Compiles a structured report summarizing industries, focus areas, use cases, and datasets.
   - Delivers a clear, systematic view of AI opportunities tailored to a company’s strategic goals.

5. **Streamlit App:** 
   - Provides an interactive interface to visualize and explore the final report and architecture.
